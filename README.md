## Overview

RNA-Seq data quality control is a critical step in ensuring the integrity and reliability of downstream analyses. This workflow:

1. Accepts raw RNA-Seq data in FASTQ format.
2. Runs FastQC to generate detailed QC reports.
3. Organizes output reports for easy review.

## Dependencies

The following tools and frameworks are required to run the workflow:

- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/): Workflow orchestration.
- [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/): Quality control analysis of high-throughput sequencing data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NextflowQC.git
   cd fastqc-rna-seq
   ```
## Usage

Run the workflow using Nextflow:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf --input '/path/to/fastq/files/' --output '/path/to/output/'
```

### Parameters

- `--input`: Path to the directory containing raw FASTQ files.
- `--output`: Path to the directory where QC reports will be stored.

## Input Files

The workflow requires:

- RNA-Seq data in FASTQ format.

Ensure that all FASTQ files are located in the directory specified by the `--input` parameter.

## Output Files

The workflow produces:

1. HTML QC reports for each input FASTQ file.
2. Summary statistics files (.txt).

All output files are stored in the directory specified by the `--output` parameter.
